                    <hr>
                    <p>I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Electrical Engineering. I love leraning as much as I can about different Software
                        Engineering disciplines. I'm interested in Embedded Systems, hence my minor in Electrical Engineering.  I think it's important
                        to get a broad understanding on all concepts of software before figuring out what you love and want to specialize in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My goal after college is to eventually get a job at a large tech company so that I can learn as much as possible from the smartest
                        people.  Eventually, I would love to start my own company although I'm not quite sure what kind of company I would make. In the meantime
                        I have Software Engineering internship with Collins Aerospace, and I've just signed a full-time offer post graduation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm hoping this class will help me understand deeper web development technologies, specifically web servers as they interest me.
                        I'm also hoping to learn about web assembly, as I know that is the new technology that is making websites a lot faster and would
                        love to see underneath the hood of how that works.
