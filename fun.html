                    <p>
                        I've been playing basketball since I was a little kid and its my favorite sport.  I'm a fan of
                        the Timberwolves but also the Bulls since Demar DeRozan is my favorite player.  I played basketball
                        throughout highschool but now I just play intramurals here at St. Thomas.  Pictured below is me at
                        an annual 3 on 3 tournament my friends from highschool put on.

                    <p>
                        Snowboarding is one of my favorite past times in the winter.  It gives me an opportunity to go outside
                        and enjoy the outdoors in the winter even when its freezing cold out. Pictured below is me at Afton Alps
                        in Woodbury. I usually end up taking a yearly trip to Colorado with my family to ride bigger slopes.

                    <p>
                        I play a lot of different games in my freetime. It's a great way to bond with friends and be able to interact
                        with them when they're not in the same room as you. Some of my best friends are people who I've met gaming online.
                        My favorite game to play are Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Civilization 5, and NBA 2K22.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I was never a big fisherman growing up but I've gotten into it recently. My Mom has recently moved to Florida
                        and it's a lot of fun being able to catch larger fish in the swamps around where she lives.  It's a lot different
                        to fishing in Minnnesota as there is way more variety in what you can catch.
